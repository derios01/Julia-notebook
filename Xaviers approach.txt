XAVIER'S APPROACH USING CO2SYS

[23:56, 13/10/2022] Xavier Brilliant Planet:
Essentially I calculated the carbon drawdown from adding a certain amount of alkalinity
to seawater. In this case specifically I took water with 600000 uM of alkalinity and a DIC of 1600 (that's an assumption but this value
won't affect the end result much at all) then mixed it with different volumes of seawater (whose carbon chemistry is on the
LCA&MRV PowerPoint presentation). 
I then now have mixed water with new alkalinity, dic and volume, call it ta_mix, dic_mix and V_tot. 
Next step is to calculate what the dic of this water will be after the partial pressure (pCO2) goes back to the seawater value (412ppm I
believe). That is simply done in co2sys by taking the par1 to be ta= ta_mix and par2 to be pCO2 = 412 and then getting the dic of the
result from co2sys, call it dic_eq (stands for dic after equilibration). Finally then the amount of CO2 absorbed from the gas exchange
equilibration process is CO2_drawdown = V_tot * (dic_eq - dic_mix). We multiply by V as the difference in dic would only give a change
per litre (do make sure V_tot is in litres). We can then get the CO2_drawdown per mole of alkalinity by doing CO2_drawdown (in uM)/600000
where 600000 is the amount of uM added (that is by taking the volume of discharge water to be 1litre). Also worth mentioning your Volume of
seawater to mix with is probably gonna need to be quite high before you max out the co2 drawdown per unit alkalinity added so if you want
to try and do this calculation do test out multiple volumes and see if co2 drawdown stabilises to a value or if it still increases üëç
